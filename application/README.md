## Motivation 

Development on this project was started for the "Health and Safety Monitoring" Deephack in September 2021. See

## Hardware requirements

In this project we used pretrained models for Luxonis Hardware. Specifically we used the OAK-D-IoT-40 board containing three cameras and a Myriad X VPU. See https://shop.luxonis.com/products/bw1092 for more information.

In general the Myriad X VPU is also available with other hardware. As this project makes use of the intgrated cameras of the OAK-D-IoT-40 it will not directly be usable on other harware, but portable with some effort
